A modular, ROS2-based robotic system for semi-autonomous navigation using synced stereo vision, real-time obstacle detection, waypoint management, and route planning. Designed for low-cost hardware and real-time responsiveness.

> ðŸš€ Used to successfully navigate a 4-aisle indoor environment with dynamic obstacle detection and directional guidance. [Demo Video](https://youtu.be/ynSF1JhdaX4?t=409) | [Project Resource List](https://github.com/ucf-sd-spsu25g10)

## 1. Key Features

* **Waypoint Orderer**  
  Read in grocery lists from a webapp and optimize route using S-shaped aisle traversal logic.
  
* **Waypoint Manager**  
  Tracks localization from RTAB-Map, determines proximity to next goal, and outputs control signals (e.g. "turn left", "approaching item").
  
* **Obstacle Detection**  
  Real-time stereo depth-based obstacle detection with audible warnings for hazards < 2m ahead.

* **Stereo Vision Driver**  
  Custom ROS2 node using OpenCV + GStreamer to provide synced stereo feeds from UVC cameras.

* **RTAB-Map Integration**  
  Tuned stereo odometry with low-computation real-time SLAM using disparity and point clouds.

## 2. Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and build the workspace
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ucf-sd-spsu25g10/navis_ros2.git
cd ..
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```

---
## 3. System Breakdown

```bash
ros2 launch navis_nav system.launch.py
```

Launched nodes (`package`: node)
* `stereo_cam`: stereo_node
  * Synced UVC camera driver
  * [Repository](https://github.com/adenm-10/stereo-cam?tab=readme-ov-file#8-troubleshooting)
* `rtabmap_slam`: rtabmap
  * RTAB-Map stereo SPLAM stack
  * [Repository](https://github.com/introlab/rtabmap_ros)
* `navis_nav`: control_out_node
  * A node to call specific speaker lines and buzzer strengths
* `navis_nav`: obstacle_detection
  * Based on generated disparity map, output closest obstacle distance
  * Written by Michael Castiglia
* `navis_nav`: waypoint_orderer
  * Retrieve an unordered list of groceries from web app, and order them in respect so S-Shape routing
* `navis_nav`: waypoint_manager
  * Uses RTAB-Map transform data and current pose to determine if the user is approaching a goal, and triggers directional output (left, right, arrived) to navigate the shopper.

## 4. Troubleshooting
1. No cameras detected:
   - **Check payload type, resolution, and framerate compatibility for both cameras**
     - Read about UVC camera configuration [here](https://github.com/adenm-10/stereo-cam?tab=readme-ov-file#4-configuration)
   - Verify camera permissions
   - Ensure all packages are properly installed

2. Poor performance:
    - Check poor performance section of stereo_cam readme for suggestions here:
